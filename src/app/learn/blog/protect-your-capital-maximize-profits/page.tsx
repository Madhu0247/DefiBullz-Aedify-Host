    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Introduction</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">No matter how good your strategy is, without proper risk management, you can still lose it all. Many traders focus only on finding profitable trades but ignore the most important factor: preserving capital.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">The reality is that winning in trading isn't just about making profits—it's about managing losses. Even professional traders have losing streaks, but they stay in the game by protecting their capital and managing risk wisely.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">In this blog, we'll break down:</p>
    <ul class="mb-6 ml-6">
      <li class="mb-2">The fundamental principles of risk management</li>
      <li class="mb-2">How to use stop-losses and position sizing effectively</li>
      <li class="mb-2">The role of AI-powered risk analysis in making smarter trades</li>
      <li class="mb-2">The most common risk management mistakes and how to avoid them</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-8">By the end, you'll have a clear, actionable risk management plan to trade with confidence.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Why Risk Management is Non-Negotiable in Trading</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">The #1 reason traders blow their accounts isn't because they have a bad strategy—it's because they don't manage risk properly.</p>
    <ul class="mb-6 ml-6">
      <li class="mb-2">Even a winning strategy can fail if losses aren't controlled.</li>
      <li class="mb-2">You can't control the market, but you can control how much you risk.</li>
      <li class="mb-2">Proper risk management protects your capital, ensuring you can continue trading long-term.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-2">The Golden Rule of Trading</h3>
    <p class="mb-6 font-medium">"Never risk more than you can afford to lose."</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Top Risk Management Strategies Every Trader Should Use</h2>
    
    <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-2">1. The 1-2% Rule: Never Risk Too Much on One Trade</h3>
    <ul class="mb-6 ml-6">
      <li class="mb-2"><strong>What is it?</strong> – Only risk 1-2% of your trading capital per trade.</li>
      <li class="mb-2"><strong>Why it works</strong> – Even if you have a losing streak, your account stays protected.</li>
      <li class="mb-2"><strong>Example:</strong> If you have a $10,000 account, you should risk no more than $100-$200 per trade.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-2">2. Stop-Losses: Your Best Defense Against Big Losses</h3>
    <ul class="mb-6 ml-6">
      <li class="mb-2"><strong>What is it?</strong> – A stop-loss automatically exits your trade if the market moves against you.</li>
      <li class="mb-2"><strong>Why it works</strong> – Prevents small losses from turning into account-wiping disasters.</li>
      <li class="mb-2"><strong>Example:</strong> If you enter a trade at $100, you can set a stop-loss at $95 to limit risk.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-6"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Let AI-powered analytics calculate optimal stop-loss levels based on market conditions.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-2">3. Position Sizing: Trade the Right Amount</h3>
    <ul class="mb-6 ml-6">
      <li class="mb-2"><strong>What is it?</strong> – Adjusting your trade size to control how much you're risking per trade.</li>
      <li class="mb-2"><strong>Why it works</strong> – Prevents you from over-leveraging and losing too much in a single trade.</li>
      <li class="mb-2"><strong>Example:</strong> Instead of trading 10 contracts at high risk, reduce to 3-5 contracts for safer exposure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-2">4. Risk-to-Reward Ratio: Only Take High-Probability Trades</h3>
    <ul class="mb-6 ml-6">
      <li class="mb-2"><strong>What is it?</strong> – The amount of potential profit vs. potential loss in a trade.</li>
      <li class="mb-2"><strong>Why it works</strong> – Ensures you're taking trades with good reward potential.</li>
      <li class="mb-2"><strong>Ideal Ratio:</strong> At least 1:2 or 1:3 (risking $1 to make $2 or $3).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-6">AI can scan thousands of trades in seconds to identify high reward-to-risk setups.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-2">5. Diversification: Don't Put All Your Money in One Trade</h3>
    <ul class="mb-6 ml-6">
      <li class="mb-2"><strong>What is it?</strong> – Spreading your capital across multiple assets or strategies.</li>
      <li class="mb-2"><strong>Why it works</strong> – Reduces exposure to a single market crash or bad trade.</li>
      <li class="mb-2"><strong>Example:</strong> Trade a mix of stocks, forex, and crypto instead of just one asset.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">How AI Can Help You Manage Risk Smarter</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">AI-powered risk management removes human error and makes risk assessment smarter and faster.</p>
    <ul class="mb-6 ml-6">
      <li class="mb-2"><strong>Automated Stop-Loss Adjustments</strong> – AI calculates the best stop-loss based on real-time market conditions.</li>
      <li class="mb-2"><strong>Dynamic Position Sizing</strong> – AI recommends trade size based on your capital and risk tolerance.</li>
      <li class="mb-2"><strong>Real-Time Risk Alerts</strong> – AI warns you when a trade exceeds your predefined risk limits.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-6">With AI-driven risk management, you don't have to manually calculate everything—AI handles it for you.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Common Risk Management Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)</h2>
    <ul class="mb-6 ml-6">
      <li class="mb-2"><strong>Over-Leveraging</strong> – Taking too large of a position can wipe out your account.</li>
      <li class="mb-2"><strong>Ignoring Stop-Losses</strong> – Holding onto losing trades hoping they recover leads to disaster.</li>
      <li class="mb-2"><strong>Revenge Trading</strong> – Trying to "make back" losses with emotional, high-risk trades.</li>
      <li class="mb-2"><strong>Not Following a Risk Plan</strong> – Inconsistent risk management leads to inconsistent results.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-6"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Always review your trades using an AI-powered trading journal to track your risk management performance.</p>
